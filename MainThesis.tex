% Bibliography
%****************************************************
%CHOOSE YOUR BIB STYLE AND FILE.
%We have included the following two referencing styles for you to use in your thesis. You can add an alternate style if you prefer.

%Style: apalike = this is an (Author, Year) referencing style similar to APA
%Style: elsarticle-num = this is a numbered referencing style that will display the bibliography in citation order

%To use one of the styles provided ensure the % is removed from the start of the line, and the other option is commented out with a % at the start of the line. The style elsarticle-num is active by default.

\printbibliography

%When you have finished your thesis we recommend that you manually fix any errors in your bibliography. 
%To do this, compile, copy the .bbl into a new .tex file and include this here after commenting out the other bibliography commands. Make corrections in that .tex file.
